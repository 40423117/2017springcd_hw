In the 2017 release, we followed our vision and implement a lot more features, delivering more technology for your HyperWorks units investment.

`在2017年版本中，我們遵循了我們的願景並實施了更多功能，為您的HyperWorks單位投資提供更多技術。`

In our continuous development, we focused, as# always, on simulation-driven innovation, adding more optimization technology.

`在我們的不斷發展中，我們一如既往地專注於模擬驅動的創新，增加更多的優化技術。`

We added more physics simulation to the software, and we improved our parallel performance on high performance computers.

`我們增加了許多的物理的模擬，我們提高了高性能電腦的平行性能。`

OptiStruct, which is our implicit code, adds a lot of development in the nonlinear implicit area, but also in the optimization technology.

`OptiStruct是我們的隱式代碼，在非線性隱含區域中，也在優化技術中添加了很多開發。`

RADIOSS, we see a lot of development in new materials and material modeling.

`RADIOSS，我們看到很多新材料和材料建模的發展。`

You probably know that we did the acquisition of MDS a couple of years back, and we have now MDS integrated with RSDIOSS, and are doing application there.

`您可能知道我們在幾年前就完成了MDS的收購，現在我們已經將MDS與RSDIOSS整合，並開始應用。`

MotionSolve is based on a very unique formulation that this different from other multibody dynamics code, and the formulation lends itself very well to optimization implementation.

`MoMotionSolvetionSolve是根據一個非常獨特的公式，這不同於其他多體動力學代碼，MotionSolve公式本身非常好地優化實施。`

So the team has worked really hard on contact formulations, got very robust.

`因此團隊對於接觸公式非常努力，獲得了非常強大的。`

It's very cool which kind of problems can solve with contact modelling.

`這類型的問題可以解決與接觸建模這是非常酷的。`

So this is along the structural solvers side on AcuSolve side we actually added the complete portfolio of turbulence and transition models that really helps us to solve problems in wind turbines and automotive industry much more accurately, and it’s a big asset of physics simulation.

`因此，這是沿著AcuSolve一側的結構解算方面，我們實際添加了完整的湍流和轉換模型組合，真正幫助我們更準確地解決風力渦輪機和汽車行業的問題，這是物理仿真的一個重要的資產。`

And then our electromagnetic suite has actually grown last year through the acquisition of Flux, from the CEDRAT company.

`然後，我們的電磁套件實際上是去年通過從CEDRAT公司收購Flux而實現的。`

As well as the acquisition of WinProp, from AWE.

`以及從AWE收購WinProp。`

So now we have a complete frequency spectrum from low frequency electromagnetics the high frequency electromagnetics which is powered by FEKO.

`所以現在我們有一個完整的頻譜從低頻電磁學的高頻電磁學由FEKO供電。`

We now have a complete portfolio of physics modeling available for our customers, and it’s all linked through optimization.

`我們現在有一個完整的物理建模組合可用於我們的客戶，它都通過優化鏈接。`
